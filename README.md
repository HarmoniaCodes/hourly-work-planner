# Work Day Planner

## Description
This tool can be used to help plan your day hour-by-hour. It can help students plan out their studies or class schedule. It can also be used to plan for upcoming meetings or events.

This planner was created to display my knowledge of implementing third-party APIs, including jQuery, dayjs, bootstrap, and Google Fonts. 

## How to use

### Setting Your Start Time and Number of Working Hours
- The default setting of this planner allows for 8 hour-long time slots. This can be changed by editing the value for the "workingHours" variable (default is 9).
- You can also edit when your day starts using a value of 0-23 for the "startingHour" variable (default is 9). 

### Setting and Storing Hourly Data
- By typing data into the text area in the middle of each time block, you can create notes, events, or meeting details in plain text form. 
- Be sure to click the floppy disk icon to save your data! Data will be cleared when your browser storage is deleted.
